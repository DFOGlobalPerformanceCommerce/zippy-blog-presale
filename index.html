                    <h1><span id="dynamicGeo"></span> Are Taking Advantage of New 2018 Rule That Allows Anyone To Get FREE TV In HD, Causing Millions To Cancel Cable</h1>

                    <h4>If you could stop paying for cable or satellite TV and still get all of your favorite TV channels in HD for FREE, would you do it? Millions of savvy <span id="dynamicGeo"></span> are taking advantage of a brand new rule in 2018 that allows certain regions access to free TV.</h4>
                    <p>Cable and satellite TV can be a big monthly charge, and they’re going up around 6 percent per year. If you’re fed up paying high bills to watch TV or find that you don’t use all the channels you pay for, there’s a new rule that allows you to watch all of your favorite channels in HD for free.</p>
                    <p>The truth is, anybody who is paying for a cable or satellite subscription is getting ripped off. <span id="dynamicGeo"></span> spend an average of $850 per year on cable or satellite TV alone and is set to increase to over $1,000 per year in another 3 years.</p>
                    <p>That's expensive and quite simply, a big waste of money.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, if you live in an area where this new rule went into effect, you no longer need to give your hard earned money away to the big cable companies. As a result, <span id="dynamicGeo"></span> are now cutting the cord on their cable companies in record numbers, saving them thousands of dollars.</p>
                    <h2>The new 2018 rule cable companies don't want you to know about… </h2>
                    <p>Up until 2018, cable companies were allowed to "scramble" their channels so that the general public could not access them without paying for their service. However, that all changed starting in 2018, with the government ruling that TV signals are public property and "belong to the people". Ever since this rule went into effect, the big cable companies are panicking because many <span id="dynamicGeo"></span> will no longer need to pay for cable or satellite tv to get their favorite channels in HD. As long as you live in a publicly broadcasted area, it is now possible to watch all of your favorite channels for free with a TV antenna.</p>
                    <p>However, not all TV antennas will work. In an attempt to block the public from picking up their TV signals, the cable companies are broadcasting their signals at very low frequencies since most antennas will not be able to pick them up. The trick is to get an antenna that can reliably pick up these low frequency signals, and up until now, there hasn’t been an antenna advanced enough to pick these signals up reliably.  (There are other antennas out on the market, but they fail miserably in comparison to this one).</p>
                    <p>Developed by a NASA engineer using military technology, the TVSurf HDTV Antenna was just released this year so that it could specifically pick up these signals reliably and has been hailed as the only "super" HDTV antenna. It uses a discrete mud flap modern design which makes it the most reliable and technologically advanced antenna to hit the market today. It can pick up signals out to 60 miles with no problem (as well as the low frequency signals) to enable you to receive free crystal-clear HD channels.</p>
                    <h2>We tested it out for ourselves...</h2>
                    <p>When we first heard about this new “super” HDTV antenna, we were a bit skeptical. So, we decided to buy one ourselves and test it out.</p>
                    <p>The antenna is supposed to work flawlessly in both the city and the countryside, but for our purposes, we drove out to the countryside to conduct our test.</p>
                    <p>Setup was fast and easy. We simply plugged it into the TV and stuck the antenna to the window (you don’t have to stick it to the window, you can stick it anywhere you want).</p>
                    <div class="img-wrap">
                        <img src="images/RniI0FD.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <h2>What happened next was astonishing...</h2>
                    <p>We turned the TV on and found ourselves staring back at an incredibly clear channel in HD. We kept flipping through channels and to our amazement, every channel was crystal clear. Best of all, we received almost all of the most popular channels you would get with cable.</p>
                    <p>All in all, we were able to access 68 channels in 1080 HD. It was as if we were getting free cable or satellite TV.</p>
                    <p>Now, before you cancel your cable or satellite subscription, it is important to note that  there were a few channels that we could not get with the antenna. But in the end, we were able to receive about 85% of the same channels and more importantly, they were the most popular channels that people actually watch.</p>
                    <p><b>The verdict:</b> If you want to save thousands of dollars and stop paying for cable or satellite tv, and don't mind losing out on a few random channels you probably won't even watch, you should try the SkyWire HDTV Antenna. If you're not happy with it, you can always return it for a full refund.</p>
                    <p><b>*Update: Friday, April 27, 2018*</b> - Since the creation of the 2018 program earlier this year, the HDTV Antenna is so popular it has sold over 1.8 million units. To help seniors take advantage of this opportunity, they've decided to offer a one-time discount of 50% off to seniors.</p>
